   # My Journey in IT 🚀

   ## Early Discovery
   My fascination with the world of Information Technology began in my first year of college, even though my major was in management. It was during this time that I stumbled upon the power and possibilities of IT.

   ## The Python Leap
   I took my first steps into the programming world by diving into Python. Its simplicity and versatility sparked my curiosity and laid the foundation for my understanding of programming concepts.

   ## Exploring the Command Line
   From Python, I ventured into PowerShell and later into the world of C. These languages not only introduced me to the intricacies of coding but also provided insights into how computers work at a fundamental level. It was here that I delved into data structures and algorithms, enriching my problem-solving skills.

   ## Embracing Open Source and Linux
   As I deepened my technical journey, I transitioned to using Linux as my primary operating system. Embracing open source became second nature, and it has been an integral part of my workflow ever since.

   ## Low-Level Marvels with Arduino
   My love for low-level programming and embedded systems ignited when I explored the fascinating world of Arduino. The ability to work with hardware and understand the intricacies of low-level programming was both challenging and incredibly rewarding.

   ## The Web Beckons
   Returning to Python, I expanded my skill set to include web development. I dived into HTML and CSS, and as my curiosity grew, I explored networking, server management, and deployment strategies.

   ## Commitment to Django
   Currently, I'm committed to mastering the Django framework for full-stack development. Its robust features and elegant design align perfectly with my passion for building scalable and efficient web applications.

   My journey is an ongoing adventure, and I'm always excited to learn and explore new horizons in the ever-evolving field of technology.
